# Undergraduate-thesis
The following is the coding for my thesis using decision tree type machine learning using microML by TronixLab. Which is implemented on the Arduino nano, as well as using a flex sensor to use the sensor media for data collection

To understand the concept of microML, here is the link " https://github.com/TronixLab/ArduinoMicroML "

In this project I use the concept of current and previous. so that data changes that occur due to body movement can be minimized by using this concept.
